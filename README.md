</div>


**🎯 The Problem**
In today's fast-paced world, neighbors often live side-by-side for years without connecting. Digital distractions and busy routines replace face-to-face moments. Most social platforms focus on global networks, leaving a gap for local, meaningful interactions. This leads to:

- 🏠 Social isolation in our own neighborhoods
- 🤝 Weaker community bonds and missed connections
- 🚫 Lost opportunities for collaboration and friendship
- 💔 Disconnect between digital presence and real-world community

We help people turn shared interests into shared experiences, strengthen community ties, and build a sense of belonging. Think of it as a friendly, smart digital notice board for your neighborhood.

- Interactive map integration with Google Maps API
